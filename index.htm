          <p>What am I going to do? I am not sure what to do next. I feel tired but I know I have energy. I don't want to but I know I have to. I need to but I don't want to.</p><p> I guess sometimes we need to be forced, or need some sort of pressure to act. In times of no pressure, I don't want to feel guilty, I just want to be. I think so, at least.</p><p>How much space do I really need to function? Our rooms here are so big, yet it's easy to complain that there is no space. Knowing that other people make do with much less, makes me feel spoiled and ungrateful.<p>This life is blessed, and I don't wish to take it for granted. But I am still sitting in this chair, moping on what to do next. I feel stuck in a rut.</p><p>Inaction is the action I am taking. Maybe there is some therapuetic value in it, but I know that the body likes getting into a routine. Maybe this is my day off routine: moping around until all the time is lost.<p>But I feel too tired to track my own time. Or I feel the need to compulsively look things up endlessly, until all the time is gone. Making me less prepared to act when something comes up that is mandatory for me to do.</p><p>Well anyway, back to work. Or back to rest?</p>

          <p>Life lately is quite the grind. Trying to fill in my free time with self-improvement and also doing things that I love. But with that, what should I do in order do become better? Am I stagnant or am I getting anywhere? Sitting and thinking seems to be a futile exercise, because I still end up running the hamster wheel and exit in the same spot I was prior. It's not a good feeling to be stagnant, yet at the same time I still feel hope on getting started.

<br /><br />Am I wasting too much time here? I know its unreasonable to be productive all the time, but I know I am making progress, albeit slowly. There are definitely things I can pour my resources into which will enrich the lives of me and the kids. But not having results yet makes me question myself. I don't want to have further doubts.</p>
