          <p>Life lately is quite the grind. Trying to fill in my free time with self-improvement and also doing things that I love. But with that, what should I do in order do become better? Am I stagnant or am I getting anywhere? Sitting and thinking seems to be a futile exercise, because I still end up running the hamster wheel and exit in the same spot I was prior. It's not a good feeling to be stagnant, yet at the same time I still feel hope on getting started.

<br /><br />Am I wasting too much time here? I know its unreasonable to be productive all the time, but I know I am making progress, albeit slowly. There are definitely things I can pour my resources into which will enrich the lives of me and the kids. But not having results yet makes me question myself. I don't want to have further doubts.</p>
